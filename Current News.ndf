Welcome to Sleepychat!
Did you know there's an erotic hypnosis convention in Chicago on July 10-12? Visit <a href="http://www.meehu.org/" target="_blank">MEEHU.org</a> for details! (And let Ely know because he might go and get us shirts!)
The site is scheduled to restart daily at 10 AM Central Time. Up to an hour before this time, we ask that no hypnosis take place.
Sleepychat has a twitter account! You can follow it and tweet about it <a href="https://twitter.com/SleepychatHypno" target="_blank">@SleepychatHypno</a>!
<span style="color: red;">Important!</span> Some hypnotists are using pastebin hypnosis scripts with ill intent. For now, <strong>please do not accept pastebin hypnosis scripts!</strong>
